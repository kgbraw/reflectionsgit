How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It allows to focus the bug search on the version differences.
    
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It allows to go back to earlier versions in case some
    modifications were not correct or productive.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: all commits can be thought by a person to give them logical
    unity.
    Cons: it requires more work, and a logical unit is a subjective
    measure, not always common to several people.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because Git is oriented towards programs, that have to be
    coherently consistent between multiple files, while Google Docs
    could or could not be consistent.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log allows following the history of a repository between
    commits, and git diff the differences between all the files
    between two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because I can always go back to before things were broken.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
