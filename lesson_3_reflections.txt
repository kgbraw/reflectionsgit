When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you are sharing your work with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because you may be working on some concept on the working directory and
    the staging area and you do not want them overwritten.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are clones whose parents are reflected in github, clones are
    repository copies that are unrelated, and branches are different
    versions of a code inside the same repository. The difference
    between clones and branches is that branches are in the same
    repository and the difference beteween forks and clones is that
    forks have a master / copy relationship.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    That you can work on a quite advanced copy of the remote without
    needing interaction with the remote. The usage of the local copy
    allows to calculate differences and makes merging easier.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    There should be a lot of talking on the phone and merges and pull
    / push would be less automatic.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When I'd like to make a major change that may take some time and
    may break things in master, it's better to use a branch.
